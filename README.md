End-to-End Analytical Model Development

## Overview

The final project for this course involves the comprehensive development of an analytical model from start to finish. This project will be executed in a structured manner, divided into multiple stages to ensure thorough analysis and development. 

## Project Stages

The project will be completed in the following stages:

1. **Stage I: Data/Project Understanding**
   - **Objective**: Gain a deep understanding of the dataset and the project's goals.
   - **Tasks**: Data exploration, project scoping, and identifying key objectives.

2. **Stage II: Data Modeling**
   - **Objective**: Develop and refine models based on the dataset.
   - **Tasks**: Building statistical and/or machine learning models to analyze the data.

3. **Stage III: Distributions and Hypothesis Testing**
   - **Objective**: Analyze data distributions and conduct hypothesis testing.
   - **Tasks**: Statistical analysis, validation of assumptions, and testing hypotheses.

4. **Stage IV: Basic Machine Learning**
   - **Objective**: Apply machine learning techniques to enhance data analysis.
   - **Tasks**: Implementing and evaluating basic machine learning algorithms.

5. **Stage V: Visualization and Dashboard**
   - **Objective**: Create visualizations and interactive dashboards to present findings.
   - **Tasks**: Designing and developing dashboards and visualizations for data insights.

6. **Final Presentation & Report**
   - **Objective**: Summarize and present the project findings.
   - **Tasks**: Preparing a presentation and detailed report of the project.

## Team Structure

- **Team Formation**: Students will form teams of 3-4 members during the first week of the course.
- **Team Responsibilities**: Each team will be responsible for completing the stages of the project collaboratively.

## Deliverables

- **Presentation**: A final presentation summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, and results.
- **Report**: A comprehensive report detailing the project stages, analyses, and findings.

## Guidelines

- **Collaboration**: Effective teamwork and communication are essential for the successful completion of the project.
- **Milestones**: Ensure that each stage is completed on time to allow for proper review and integration.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear and detailed documentation throughout the project for reference and reporting.

We look forward to seeing the innovative approaches and insights generated from this project. Wish us luck!
